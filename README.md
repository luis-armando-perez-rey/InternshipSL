# Internship SL: Object Detection in Technical Images using Deep Learning
Code used for internship at [Sioux Lime](https://www.mathware.nl/) on image segmentation using U-Net architecture [1] for two applications: identification of asbestos in electron microscopy images and identification of train defects. 

Data is confidential and not available. 

# Preprocessing
Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization pre-processing and cropping of large images into parts. 
# Training
Techniques explored 
- Segmentation using U-Net
- Data augmentation (horizontal and vertical flipping depending on the application)
- Hard example mining

The methods' performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall and F1 score.
